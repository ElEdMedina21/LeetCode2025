# LeetCode2025

My goal with this repo is to develop a habit of solving problems that involve data structures and algorithms so that I can further improve my knowledge in such topics. To do so, I will solve at least 10 problems per month.


To revisit:
- 3 sum
- Move Zeroes
- Trapping Rain
- Koko Bananas
- Search Matrix
- Merge Intervals [x]
- Minimum Rotated
- Search Rotated
